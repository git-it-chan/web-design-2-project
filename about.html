                            <p>In what started as two attendees at a Clan of Xymox concert during the winter of 2019, Pierson Kardas and Chandler Goudreau - Patterson left inspired with the revelation to start their very own gothic band.</p>
                            <p>A couple months later, the COVID-19 pandemic would then hit the world—and what with two best friend roommates trapped inside due to the lockdowns, there was now an abundance of time to focus on and release an EP and an album in the band’s first year.</p>

                                    <p>After posting the first EP to an anonymous message board, THE SEANCE received passive promotion from numerous fans, radio stations, and DJ sets all over the world. In the past, the two have collaborated on a few other music projects, but the response they got unlike anything compared to what they got with THE SEANCE. The band is known for their "easy-going" approach with danceable synth beats, contrasted with macabre vocals and lyrics—it's a <i>bittersweet</i> sonic cocktail for goths and casual listeners alike.</p>

                                <p>As introverts by nature, Goudreau-Patterson and Kardas initially had no interest in performing live. However, as a result of this recognition, a radio host suggested the band to Nashville's Palm Ghosts, who then invited them to perform live with them. THE SEANCE have since played a total of 3 live shows, having played with The City Gates, and the Juno-nominated—ODONIS ODONIS.</p>
